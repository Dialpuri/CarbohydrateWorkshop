    <h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Part 2 of the Carbohydrate Crystallography Workshop! If you completed Part 1, we will be validating
        the carbohydrate chain you modelled in Part 1. If you didn't finish Part 1, don't worry you can still follow
        along!</p>

    <p>We will be using a software package called <i>Privateer</i> to validate our glycans. <i>Privateer</i> is the
        Swiss Army
        knife for carbohydrate structure validation, refinement and analysis. Carbohydrates, including O- and N-glycans
        attached to protein and lipid structures, are known to be important in cellular biology. Therefore, we want
        models
        of glycans to be as accurate as possible, but in many cases, carbohydrates have been found to be deposited into
        the
        Protein Data Bank with errors. Identifying these problems was the initial goal of <i>Privateer</i> and today
        <i>Privateer</i> is routinely used before structures are deposited.
    </p>

    <p><i>Privateer</i> is accessible in many interfaces such as CCP4i2, CCP4 Cloud, and CCP-EM, but we will be using
        the
        new <i>Privateer</i> Web App in this workshop.</p>

    <h3 id="gettingstarted">2. Getting Started</h3>

    <p>To launch the <i>Privateer</i> Web App navigate to this URL.</p>
    <p class="centered"><a href="https://privateer.york.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://privateer.york.ac.uk/</a>
    </p>

    <p>&#128296; <b>Upload</b> the the coordinate file and MTZ file generated in Part 1 of the workshop, by clicking on
        the
        <code class="inline-code"><img class="icon-code" src="images/webapp/upload_icon.png"
                                       alt="Upload icon in the Privateer Web App">Choose a file </code> button.
        After uploading both icons, you are ready to submit the structures for validation by <i>Privateer</i>, hit the
        <code class="inline-code">Submit</code> button and <i>Privateer</i> will begin processing your structure within
        your web browser.
    </p>
    <div class="centered-image"><img class="centered" src="images/webapp/upload_box.png"
                                     alt="Upload box in the Privateer Web App"></div>

    <p>
        Once <i>Privateer</i> has completed (should take only a few seconds), you will a see a
        table that contain a list of glycan chains (or ligands) in the model. Each entry in the table contains a chain
        ID,
        a linkage ID, an image representation of the glycan known as the Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) and two
        database accession IDs. There were a number of other glycans in the structure, but we are interested in the
        glycan on the newly modelled chain.
    </p>

    <div class="centered-image"><img class="centered" src="images/webapp/table.png"
                                     alt="Table result in the Privateer Web App"></div>

    <p>ðŸ”¨ <b>Click</b> on the glycan chain that you added (on A/ASN/476) to open up a more detailed validation report,
        which will tell us how well you did!</p>

    <h3 id="validation">3. Validation Report</h3>

    <p>
        <i>Privateer</i> identifies <b>incorrect</b> regiochemistry, stereochemistry and unlikely ring conformations,
        including:
    <ul>
        <li>Conformation issues: As pyranose (sugar) rings have clear conformational preferences for the 4C1 chair
            ring pucker, any other detected ring conformation is highlighted as a possible issue.
        </li>
        <li>Anomer issues: Identifies discrepancies between the calculated anomer (alpha or beta) and that annotated
            in the related CCD code.
        </li>
        <li>Torsion issues: Reports the number of torsion pair outliers.</li>
        <li>Pucker issues: Focuses on the precise geometric distortion of the ring, often expressed in terms of
            puckering parameters.
        </li>
        <li>Chirality issues: Identifies discrepancies between the calculated anomer (D or L) and that annotated in the
            related CCD code.
        </li>
    </ul>

    We can see this summarised in the first part of the <i>Privateer</i> validation report.

    <details>
        <summary>ðŸ’¡ Does the glycan you modelled have any issues?</summary>
        <p class="indent">Hopefully not, but if you did, you would see what the problem was through this issue
            count.</p>
    </details>

    <p>You can also check whether the glycan you have created is already known about by looking for accession codes for
        the
        GlyTouCan and GlyConnect databases.</p>
    <details>
        <summary>What are they?</summary>
        <p class="indent">The GlyTouCan database<sup>1</sup> is an uncurated international repository of all known
            glycans
            from a range of sources. If your glycan has a GlyTouCan accession code, it has been seen before. The
            GlyConnect
            database is a knowledgebase which links varying data sources related to glycans, if your glycan has a
            GlyConnect
            accession code, it is likely to be confirmed via multiple independent methods.</p>
    </details>

    <h3 id="snfg">4. SNFG and Moorhen Visualisation</h3>
    <p>
        The Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) is a standardised system that uses unique symbols to represent
        different
        monosaccharides in glycan structures.
    </p>
    <p>
        The white box in the SNFG indicates the residue in the protein to which the glycan is attached.
        The different coloured shapes represent the different sugars in the glycan chains, with annotated links
        that inform the linkage type (e.g. alpha or beta linkage, from which atom number).
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/webapp/snfg-and-moorhen.png" alt="Image of SNFG and Moorhen Visualisation">
    </p>
    <p>ðŸ”¨ <b>Hover</b> over the links and sugars in the SNFG to provide more detailed validation information. If they are
        highlighted in orange, Privateer has detected an issue. </p>
    <p>ðŸ”¨ <b>Click</b> on the sugars in the SNFG will take you directly to that same sugar in the Moorhen viewer. </p>

    <p>ðŸ’¡Does the density support the glycan chain you have modelled?</p>

    <p>Hopefully the glycan you modelled has no issues, but in the future, using the <i>Privateer</i>
        Web App is a quick and easy way to check how well you've done with modelling glycans. Now, we
        will look at an example which could use some improvement.</p>

    <h3 id="casestudy">5. Case Study</h3>

    <p>Refresh the <i>Privateer</i> page or click the logo in the top-left to get back to the start
        of the web app. We are ready to look at an example from the PDB with some errors.</p>

    <p>ðŸ”¨ <b>Fetch</b> PDB code â€˜3QVPâ€™ from the PDB.</p>

    <p>ðŸ”¨ <b>Click</b> on any rows to get detailed validation information about a specific glycan chain.

    <p>ðŸ’¡The first glycan chain in 3QVP has two issues:
    <ul>
        <li>conformation issues</li>
        <li>torsion issue</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>ðŸ”¨ <b>Hover</b> over the links and sugars in the SNFG to provide more detailed validation information. If they are
        highlighted in orange, Privateer has detected an issue.
    </p>

    <p>ðŸ’¡What high energy conformer has been calculated by Privateer?
    </p>

    <p>ðŸ”¨ <b>Click</b> on the sugars in the SNFG will take you directly to that same sugar in the Moorhen viewer.
    </p>

    <p>ðŸ’¡Does the density support the high energy ring conformer?
    </p>

    <p>ðŸ”¨ Try looking at these structures:
    <ul>
        <li>2H6O</li>
        <li>5FJI</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Which of these structures contains well-modelled sugars? What are the issues with the examples that are not
    well-modelled? Is it a biochemical or modelling error?
    </p>
